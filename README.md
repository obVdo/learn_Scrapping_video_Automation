# learn_Scrapping_video_Automation
Just for fun, a python approch to create automated videos from top reddit threads with selenium and moviepy. Mostly because i saw hundreds of yt channels posting ungodly amounts of reddit videos and i was curious if i can make something that can do the same. I wont recommend using the code for commercial purposes. While such videos may not be entirely original, if you have a unique concept that incorporates Reddit commentary, I hope you find this code useful.But do as you wish :)
Make sure you have a background_videos folder with some videos and a trans.mp4 for transitioning between videos.
